# react-chat-engine
I use to make this chat-engine : react, firebase, react-hooks, axios, chatengine , react-router-dom and context-API.<br>
This chat engine work perfectly. if you use this chat-engine then you login your google account and chat your friend. active status have also this chat engine.
#Note : this is only group chat I mean if you chat other person then you have to create a group with that person then starting chat.
